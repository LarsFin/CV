### What have I been up to?
At Makers I was always passionate to expand my knowledge in the field of programming whether it be a new language, framework or technology. My projects show this, having chosen ones with the primary goal to learn as much as possible on a subject. In these projects I needed to grasp complex concepts quickly and understand how to apply them effectively so I could add as much value to the team in both working myself and helping others understand these concepts. These projects are listed below;

- Building a secure Web App: https://github.com/LarsFin/Making-a-secure-web-app
- Interpreter: https://github.com/GeorgeWhiting/writing-a-programming-language

While a stop-motion artist I was able to invoke my skill in patience to ensure a steady input of hard work into a project. Like with programming the initial results were not always stunning but maintaining focus allowed me to achieve my goal, thus my determination was well rewarded. My youtube videos alone totalled over **60,000 views**.
