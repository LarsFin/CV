### About me

<img align="right" src="./dev.gif" width="248" height="184" />

I have always loved to **build**: as a child using Lego to build Bionicle robots; as a teenager using GameMaker Studios to build 2D games; as a stop-motion artist using clay to build videos for others to enjoy; and now as a software developer using my passion for programming to build applications. I have a strong desire to **learn** even more. While at Makers I developed invaluable skills to aid my learning processes. I wish to work in a team surrounded by programmers also keen to **learn** about and **build** innovative projects.

### What have I been up to?
At Makers I was always keen to expand my knowledge in the field of programming, whether it be learning a new language or framework. My projects show this. They were chosen with the primary goal of learning as much as possible about the subject. In these projects I needed to grasp complex concepts quickly and understand how to apply them effectively, so that I could add as much value to the team via my own work and also by helping others to understand these concepts. These projects are listed below:

- Building a secure Web App: https://github.com/LarsFin/Making-a-secure-web-app
- Building an Interpreter: https://github.com/GeorgeWhiting/writing-a-programming-language

While a stop-motion artist I was able to invoke my considerable patience to ensure a steady input of hard work into a project. As with programming the initial results were not always stunning but maintaining focus allowed me to achieve my goal, thus my determination was well rewarded. My youtube videos alone totalled over **60,000 views**.
