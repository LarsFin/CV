### About me
I have always loved to **build**; as a child using lego to build Bionicle robots, as a teenager using GameMaker Studios to build 2D games, as a stop-motion artist using clay to build videos for others to enjoy and now as a software developer using my passion for programming to build applications. However I love to **learn** even more, while at Makers I developed invaluable skills to aid my learning procedure. I hope to work in a team surrounded by programmers also keen to **learn** and **build** on innovative projects.

### What have I been up to?
At Makers I was always keen to expand my knowledge in the field of programming whether it be learning a new language or framework. My projects show this having chosen them with the primary goal to learn as much as possible on a subject. In these projects I needed to grasp complex concepts quickly and understand how to apply them effectively so I could add as much value to the team via working myself and also helping others to understand these concepts. These projects are listed below;

While a stop-motion artist I was able to invoke my skill in patience to ensure a steady input of hard work into a project. Like with programming the initial results were not always stunning but maintaining focus allowed me to achieve my goal, thus my determination was well rewarded. My youtube videos alone totalled over **60,000 views**.
